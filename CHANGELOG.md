## Unreleased
* (Minor): The Sphinx documentation site is no longer built or published. It was served from a GitHub Pages custom domain that stopped resolving, so nothing published there had been reachable for some time. Reference documentation for this SDK is at https://docs.getunleash.io/reference/sdks/python, and `README.md` covers installation, usage, configuration options, custom strategies, custom caches, event callbacks and the WSGI and Celery notes. Contributor setup and the release checklist are in `DEVELOPMENT.md`. The `Documentation` URL in the package metadata now points at the docs site rather than a page that returned 404.
* (Minor): Outbound HTTP now happens through one internal `Transport` object instead of the three module-level functions in `UnleashClient.api`. The requests on the wire — urls, methods, headers, bodies, status handling, the retry adapter on feature fetches, and the fatal-URL exceptions that registration re-raises — are exactly what they were. `UnleashClient.api` and its `get_feature_toggles`, `send_metrics`, `register_client` and `build_normalized_url` are gone, as is `UnleashClient.utils.log_resp_info`; `PollingConnector` now takes a `transport` instead of `url`, `app_name`, `instance_id`, `headers`, `custom_options`, `request_timeout`, `request_retries` and `project`, and `aggregate_and_send_metrics` takes one in first position instead of `url`, `headers`, `custom_options` and `request_timeout`. This only affects code importing from `UnleashClient.api`, `UnleashClient.connectors` or `UnleashClient.periodic_tasks` directly. Nothing changes for code using `UnleashClient`.
* (Minor): `Transport` asks the internal `HeaderFactory` for the header set each request needs, rather than being handed a dict built once at startup. As a result, reassigning `unleash_url`, `unleash_custom_headers`, `unleash_custom_options`, `unleash_request_timeout`, `unleash_request_retries`, `unleash_project_name`, `unleash_app_name` or `unleash_instance_id` after `initialize_client()` now takes effect on the next poll and the next metrics send. Those used to be captured when the connector and the metrics job were created, and changes to them afterwards were silently ignored. Registration always read them at call time and is unaffected. The headers on the wire are otherwise unchanged.
* (Minor): The `metrics_headers` attribute has been removed from `UnleashClient`. It used to hold the header dict handed to the metrics job at `initialize_client()`, so reassigning it changed what the metrics request sent; the `Transport` now builds that header set per request. Set `unleash_custom_headers` instead — it is read on every send.
* (Minor): The registration request body is now assembled by `build_register_payload` in the new `UnleashClient.payloads` module rather than inline in `register_client`. The fields sent are unchanged, `started` is still stamped at the moment of the request, and nothing changes for code using `UnleashClient`.
* (Minor): Job scheduling now happens through one internal `Scheduler` object instead of being re-implemented by the client and each connector. The jobs, intervals, jitter and executors are exactly what they were. `PollingConnector` and `OfflineConnector` now take that `Scheduler` rather than an APScheduler instance, and no longer take `scheduler_executor`, so code importing from `UnleashClient.connectors` directly must build one. The `scheduler` and `scheduler_executor` constructor arguments, and the `unleash_scheduler` and `unleash_executor_name` attributes, are unchanged.
* (Minor): Passing a `scheduler` that is already running no longer raises `SchedulerAlreadyRunningError`. Starting an already-started scheduler is now a no-op.
* (Minor): The unused `fl_job` attribute has been removed from `UnleashClient`. It was always `None` — the connectors own their own jobs — and nothing read it.
* (Minor): Upgraded to yggdrasil-engine 2.0. Counting toggle and variant evaluations, and deciding whether an impression event is due, now happen inside the engine rather than in the SDK. `is_enabled()` and `get_variant()` return the same types as before, so no calling code needs to change.
* (Minor): A `fallback_function` that raises now results in `False` and a logged warning, instead of the exception propagating out of `is_enabled()`. The toggle is not counted in that case.
* (Minor): Event callbacks are now invoked on a dedicated background thread instead of on whichever thread produced the event. `is_enabled()` and `get_variant()` no longer wait for your callback, so a slow callback can't hold up flag evaluation. Three consequences worth knowing about: callbacks can no longer read thread local state from the caller (Flask `g`, the current Django request, contextvars); they return before the callback has run, so tests asserting straight after the call now need to wait; and reassigning `unleash_event_callback` after construction is no longer honoured.
* (Minor): Connectors take an `EventDispatcher` instead of `ready_callback`/`event_callback`. These classes aren't part of the documented API, so this only affects code importing from `UnleashClient.connectors` directly.
* (Minor): Request headers are now assembled once, by an internal `HeaderFactory`, and passed to each collaborator complete. The headers on the wire are unchanged. `PollingConnector` and `StreamingConnector` no longer add `unleash-interval` and `Accept`/`Content-Type`/`Unleash-Client-Spec` themselves, so code importing from `UnleashClient.connectors` directly must now supply complete headers. Nothing changes for code using `UnleashClient`.
* (Minor): Applying feature state — the cache write, the handover to the engine, and the READY and FETCHED events that follow — now happens in one internal `FeatureStore` instead of being re-implemented by each connector. The cache writes, engine updates and events are exactly what they were. Connectors now take a `store` instead of `engine`, `cache` and `events`, and `BaseConnector.load_features()` is gone, so code importing from `UnleashClient.connectors` directly must build a `FeatureStore` and call `store.load_from_cache()`. Nothing changes for code using `UnleashClient`.
* (Minor): The `engine` and `cache` attributes are gone from `UnleashClient`. Both were always configured through the constructor — pass `cache=` to supply your own — and neither appears in the documented API.
* (Bugfix): `refresh_jitter` now reaches the polling job. It was accepted by the constructor, documented, and applied to the offline refresh job, but never passed to the polling connector, so jitter was silently dropped in the default polling mode.
* (Minor): Constructor arguments are now normalized once into an internal `UnleashConfig` object rather than being copied onto the client attribute by attribute. The public `unleash_*` attributes keep their exact values and stay writable — they now read and write through that object — so nothing in calling code needs to change. This is groundwork for an asynchronous client that shares the same configuration handling.
